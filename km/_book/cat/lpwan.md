# LPWAN
* low-power wide-area network

## about
* designed to allow long-range communications at a low bit rate 
* LTE-M (short of LTE-MTC - Machine Type Communication) includes eMTC (enhanced Machine Type Communication)
* The advantage of LTE-M over NB-IoT is its comparatively higher data rate, mobility, and voice over the network, but it requires more bandwidth
